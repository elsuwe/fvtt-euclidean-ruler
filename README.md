# Manhattan Ruler

This module modifies the Foundry ruler to use [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) measurement, sometimes known as taxicab geometry. In other words, diagonals are equal to the distance moved horizontally + vertically along the grid.

0.1.0 onwards requires Foundry v10.
